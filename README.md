# Smart Contracts for Cartesi Rollups

This repository contains the on-chain part of Cartesi Rollups.

If you are interested in taking a look at the off-chain part, please, head over to [`cartesi/rollups-node`](https://github.com/cartesi/rollups-node).

## üß© Dependencies

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## üí° Basic setup

This repository contains [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
In order to properly initialize them, please, run the following command.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This repository uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to manage JavaScript dependencies.
In order to install them, please, run the following commands.

```sh
cd onchain/rollups
yarn install
```

## üöÄ Local deployment

If you want to run a [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) node and deploy the contracts, please run the following command.

```sh
yarn start
```

If, instead, you wish to deploy the contracts to an already running node (e.g. [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/)), you can do so by running the following command.

```sh
yarn deploy:development
```

If the node is not listening to `http://localhost:8545/`, please set the `RPC_URL` environment variable accordingly.

## üß™ Tests

If you plan to run the [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) tests, there still some setup left to do.
Assuming you are on the `onchain/rollups` directory, and that [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is running on the background, you may run the following command.
This command will build the Cartesi Machine image necessary to build the proofs.

```sh
yarn proofs:setup
```

Now, you may run the tests!

```sh
yarn test
```

From this point on, after any change in the source code, you can update the proofs before running the tests again with the following command.

```sh
yarn proofs:update
```

-   Made each Portal a contract of their own, and shared amongst all the DApps
-   Made inputs added by Portals more compact by using the [packed ABI encoding](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) instead of the standard one
-   Made ERC-20 deposits more generic by allowing base layer transfers to fail, and adding a boolean field signaling whether it was successful or not
-   Made ERC-721 deposits more generic by adding an arbitrary data field to be interpreted by the off-chain machine in the execution layer
-   Moved the input boxes of every DApp into a single, permissionless contract
-   Input boxes are now append-onlyâ€”they are not cleared every new epoch (old Input Facet)
-   Modularized the consensus layer (a DApp can now seamlessly change its consensus model)
-   Modularized the claim storage layer (a consensus can now seamlessly change how it stores claims)
-   Voucher bitmask position is now determined by the input index (in the input box) and output index
-   Validators need now to specify the range of inputs of each claim they submit on-chain
-   Removed Setup Input
-   Removed Quorum consensus model implementation (up to 8 validators)
-   Removed Bank contract
-   Removed DApp configuration parameters related to the off-chain machine specs (now defined as constants)

### Minor Changes

-   Added Authority consensus model implementation (single validator)
-   Added Simple claim storage implementation (one claim per DApp)
-   Added Library that defines several constants related to the canonical off-chain machine
